11:35:29 From Liz Jones-Minsinger to Everyone:
	Margaret Hamilton?

11:54:07 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	could you repeat‚Äù ‚Äúwhat software to run‚Äù ‚Äúwhat to do‚Äù etc etf

11:57:29 From Brendan Coates to Everyone:
	yeah so, the "command" is the software to run, the "options" are how to run it, and the "arguments" are what to run the software on

12:02:14 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	thanks!

12:06:12 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	fg

12:16:29 From Natalie Baur (she/her) to Everyone:
	thank you for the transparency on the learning curve üôÇ

12:18:56 From Wen Nie Ng (They/them/their) to Everyone:
	what's the hint that you can tell right-away it's python 2 from the Stack Overflow just now

12:25:06 From Kelly Bolding (she/they) to Everyone:
	this alone is going to save me so much time! :)

12:26:13 From AReporter to Everyone:
	you can just do that by putting it in a web browser tho - is it not the same? for list

12:28:09 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	I‚Äôm trying some of these in Terminal and nothing is happening. DO you have to type ‚Äò>‚Äô before everything? (Sorry- absolute novice here)

12:28:30 From Joan Gandy to Everyone:
	what was the difference for the command for Windows and Mac, sorry I missed something you said about that

12:32:52 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	In the WSL every cd command returns "No such file or directory," but when I try the same cd path in Windows command prompt it works. Is this in error in the Ubuntu set up?

12:34:41 From AReporter to Everyone:
	what about a % symbol

12:34:41 From Sarah Patton to Everyone:
	We can't see the WSL, still on your slide screen

12:34:51 From Joan Gandy to Everyone:
	I can't see it either

12:36:56 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	Any symbol before the command at this point is not to be typed.

12:37:05 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	so cd, not %cd

12:37:09 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	or >cd

13:05:14 From Jordon Steele to Everyone:
	why would you only want to see the tail end of a file?

13:05:45 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	I usually use it to read the most recent items in a logfile. Especially if it is really long.

13:08:02 From AReporter to Everyone:
	ack I made a typo and now my terminal just says quote>

13:08:04 From Wen Nie Ng (They/them/their) to Everyone:
	i'm trying to understand the use case of printing out text for the file ‚Äúcat a_file.txt‚Äù

13:08:58 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	AReporter press <CTRL-C>

13:09:26 From Jordon Steele to Everyone:
	makes sense, thanks

13:12:47 From Wen Nie Ng (They/them/their) to Everyone:
	Thank you

14:01:52 From Brendan Coates to Everyone:
	howdy, I am here if folks have questions

14:03:26 From Sarah Patton to Everyone:
	When I tried doing the echo 'Hello World!' >> a_file.txt command, I got a Permission denied error

14:03:36 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	I know. It is weirdly.

14:05:16 From Shana Sandor (she/her) to Everyone:
	when I type ls it only shows 'grabbags', not the other two programs I supposedly downloaded/added ffmpeg and mediainfo, is that right?

14:08:33 From Brendan Coates to Everyone:
	which ffmpeg

14:10:29 From AReporter to Everyone:
	the echo test didn't do anything for me - am I missing something

14:11:30 From Shana Sandor (she/her) to Everyone:
	ok, found ffmpeg and mediainfo, but can't find pyforav.zip which is downloaded to my C drive

14:12:16 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	Shana, if you are in WSL, it resides in the /mnt/c/‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ /Downloads

14:12:36 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	the ‚Ä¶. is something like Users/shana/Downloads

14:12:59 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	AReporter: I first got started using this for my work really basically--I needed to create a ton of folders for digitization all at once and used CDI to do that. I'm learning it now for more digital preservation stuff.

14:13:00 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	or maybe a OneDrive/shana/Downloads

14:13:27 From AReporter to Everyone:
	THanks - we use it to upload to our DAMS - but I just plug in the script I get from it

14:13:29 From AReporter to Everyone:
	IT

14:13:43 From Shana Sandor (she/her) to Everyone:
	thanks Bill, I think I found it!

14:13:50 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	Huzzah!

14:16:41 From Chelsea Denault to Everyone:
	üê∂!!!

14:32:45 From Kelly Bolding (she/they) to Everyone:
	With rsync for compressed files, is there a higher risk of failure or errors, or is it just slower since it has to change more content?

14:33:25 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	Can you show this in WSL?

14:34:24 From Liz Jones-Minsinger to Everyone:
	^yes please!

14:41:16 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	I am not seeing the files sync in WSL the way you described, could you go through it once again?

14:42:40 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	Nevermind, I got it

14:45:19 From Kelly Bolding (she/they) to Everyone:
	that‚Äôs helpful, thank you!

14:49:02 From Natalie Baur (she/her) to Sandy(Direct Message):
	hi sandy did you have a question?

14:52:04 From Tani Nakamoto she|hers to Everyone:
	I‚Äôm getting ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù when trying md5sum

14:52:10 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	for md5sum command not found

14:52:14 From Chelsea Denault to Everyone:
	Same!

14:52:18 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	mac

14:52:21 From Tani Nakamoto she|hers to Everyone:
    mac

14:52:22 From Chelsea Denault to Everyone:
	Mac

14:52:36 From Brendan Coates to Everyone:
	brew install md5sum

14:52:36 From Wen Nie Ng (They/them/their) to Everyone:
	i got same ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù, installed homebrew. On Mac

14:55:47 From AReporter to Everyone:
	still installing md5sum on my million year old mac

14:56:22 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	me too. it‚Äôs at 0% still. should we abort?

14:57:45 From Tani Nakamoto she|hers to Everyone:
	It‚Äôs asking me to install ‚Äúmd5sha1sum‚Äù instead?

14:58:47 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	Yes, that is both of them.

14:59:13 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	You get both md5 and sha with that command.

14:59:47 From Chelsea Denault to Everyone:
	md5sum worked for me

15:02:17 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	Will the slides (and maybe the chat?) be shared after this? That would be awesome.

15:02:27 From Jordon Steele to Everyone:
	indeed it does...thanks to both of you

15:02:59 From Liz Jones-Minsinger to Everyone:
	Slides here, Irina: https://brnco.github.io/DPOE-N-Workshop_IntroCLI-AVTools/webinar.html

15:03:15 From AReporter to Everyone:
	so I did it and it change a bunch of .mov files to .md5 - was that supposed to happen?

15:03:17 From AReporter to Everyone:
	ha

15:03:18 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	Oh duh I forgot, thanks Liz!

15:03:53 From Sam Sfirri to Everyone:
	Is there any reason why you would want to make a md5 AND sha checksum for the same file?

15:06:36 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	any good place to see how this is actually used in an archive? Somewhat hard to visualize how it would be applied.

15:16:53 From Sam Sfirri to Everyone:
	Not at all!

15:17:24 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	ooo can you share that with us?

15:19:02 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	not the script, but the flowchart. That was great

15:22:10 From Eve Perry to Everyone:
	Archivematica does not perform any of these actions? They must be performed separately through a shell script?

15:22:20 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	lol, but thanks

15:23:33 From Kelly Bolding (she/they) to Everyone:
	are those synths? :)

15:23:34 From Tani Nakamoto she|hers to Everyone:
	Awwww so cute

15:23:36 From Liz Jones-Minsinger to Everyone:
	Yay puppy!

15:23:47 From Chelsea Denault to Everyone:
	Puppy!!!

15:31:06 From Brendan Coates to Everyone:
	https://github.com/amiaopensource/grabbags

15:31:14 From Joan Gandy to Everyone:
	this is not for WSL correct?

15:47:15 From AReporter to Everyone:
	when I put in grabbage it says no command found

15:48:45 From AReporter to Everyone:
	never mind it works

15:51:23 From Reginaldo Carvalho to Everyone:
	is it possible to show how to generate baggit file with grabbags? Or does it only validate baggits files?

16:15:01 From Marta Fodor to Everyone:
	Have to get going. Thanks for the workshop

16:16:44 From Irina Rogova she/her to Everyone:
	So we are seeing a lot of issues with WSL--what are our options if our institutions don't let us control what kind of computer we work with?

16:17:10 From AReporter to Everyone:
	it was good until recently

16:17:13 From AReporter to Everyone:
	no lag

16:18:59 From Bill Bowman to Everyone:
	chmod +x
