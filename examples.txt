# to use a snippet below, copy + paste into a new file, include the shebang (#!/usr/bin/env bash) at the top, save with a .sh extension, and sudo chmod +x the script to make it executable
# lines that start with a hashtag are comments
#
# example 1 - loop over files in directory
# include the source directory you want to work on as the first argument, e.g.:$ ./script.sh ~/Downloads/pyforav/on_demand
